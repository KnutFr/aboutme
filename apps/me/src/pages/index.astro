      <p>
        Platform engineer with a deep focus on complex architecture and AI
        tooling. I design and build the infrastructure, developer platforms, and
        automation that enable teams to ship reliable software at scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work sits at the intersection of cloud-native systems, internal
        developer platforms, and the emerging wave of AI-powered development
        tools — from intelligent CI/CD pipelines to LLM-assisted workflows that
        accelerate engineering productivity.
